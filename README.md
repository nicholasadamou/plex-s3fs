# plex-s3fs 

*The hardest most confusing way type `apt install s3fs` and run `snap install plexmediaserver`.

This script literally just mounts an AWS (us-east-1 only) s3 bucket to `/mnt/bucket_name` and pastes your creds in the right file (now).

## Why create `plex-s3fs`?

I have no idea. *MUCH* harder than just reading the `s3fs` examples...

## Getting Started

## Digital Ocean Account & Droplet

All you need is a debian box.

## Amazon AWS Account & S3 Bucket

You should use wasabi's S3, not Amazon, it's much cheaper.

## Setup

Just run `install.sh`...

### Running on a headless server

You know how plex works if you came looking for this.

## Liability

This will work fine now, but... don't use this probably.
